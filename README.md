Something is wrong with my Spawner. The collectables that it spawns, it takes me two tries to activate the animation and have the object disappear. I'm not entirely sure what's wrong or how to fix, but I'm probably missing something in the triggers.

Also I'm unsure what happened to my Game window. It's been like that since forever.

Something is wrong with 2.2.2, it definitely has something to do with how I'm pulling some random angle equations to calculate the rotation. I'm still not entirely sure how one exactly does this.

# A05: Spring into Action

### Tour
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83565fd1-b2cc-4846-be8e-5d6eb5350275

There is a slight issue where the rotation in the tour script does not work when both FlyCamera.cs and Tour.cs are activated on the camera. However, once I uncheck FlyCamera.cs and only have Tour.cs running, the rotation works fine. I'm not sure where the conflict might be.

They ended up turning out rather boring, but after sinking so much time into fiddling with donuts, I lost steam when I got to the Quest Area. They're supposed to be marshmallows... I'm unsure if the final poly count if acceptable.

I am unsure how to make a gif. So all I can provide is a questionable screen recording. I hope that this is acceptable.
Thank you!
