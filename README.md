2.2.2:https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75fd9236-49ca-4cea-9d28-63508a0a7985

Something is wrong with 2.2.2, it definitely has something to do with how I'm pulling some random angle equations to calculate the rotation. I'm still not entirely sure how one exactly does this.

So the video is really scuffed becaue I recorded it on my phone because the snipping tool wouldn't work(?) and I forgot my Unity password. I really apologize for the horrible quality. Also, I'm unsure what exactly happened to my game screen.

They ended up turning out rather boring, but after sinking so much time into fiddling with donuts, I lost steam when I got to the Quest Area. They're supposed to be marshmallows... I'm unsure if the final poly count if acceptable.

I am unsure how to make a gif. So all I can provide is a questionable screen recording. I hope that this is acceptable.
Thank you!
